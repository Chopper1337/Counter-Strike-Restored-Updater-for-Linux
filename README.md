# Counter-Strike: Restored Updater for Linux

[Counter-Strike: Restored](https://csrestored.com/app)

This is not an official updater for CSR. I am not a member of the CSR team.

This updater script utilises the [CSR API](https://download-api.csrestored.com/) to individually verify files and update them if necessary.

It also supports the creation of new directories which should allow the CSR team to push updates which may require new directories instead of just new files.

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chopper1337/Counter-Strike-Restored-Updater-for-Linux
```

Copy the script to your CSR game directory:

```
cp ./Counter-Strike-Restored-Updater-for-Linux/updater.sh /path/to/csr/
```
