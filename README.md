# Counter-Strike: Restored Updater for Linux

[Counter-Strike: Restored](https://csrestored.com/app)

This is not an official updater for CSR. I am not a member of the CSR team.

## Usage

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Chopper1337/Counter-Strike-Restored-Updater-for-Linux
```

Copy the script to your CSR game directory:

```
cp ./Counter-Strike-Restored-Updater-for-Linux/updater.sh /path/to/csr/
```
